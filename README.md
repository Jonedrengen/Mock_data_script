# Mock_data_script
Contains a python script, to generate mock data

I will be creating a python script, that can create mock data for an SQL database
It will be able to insert data into the database
It will be able to update data in the database
It will be able to delete data from the database

Importing the necessary libraries, using faker to create mock data

I use anaconda to create my virtual environment
I use the following command to create my virtual environment
"conda create -n env python=3.11.5"

i then activate my virtual environment using the following command
"conda activate env"

I then install the necessary libraries using the following command
"pip install faker"

i check the version of python and the libraries using the following command
"python --version"
"pip freeze"

I then create a python script called mock_data.py
